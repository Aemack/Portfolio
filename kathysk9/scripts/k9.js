Schedules mean that mostly you will get walked twice a day, but sometimes 9-30 sometimes 10, it will happen but not at a precise time.  It is important that the dog knows his needs will be met, but he should not be pinned down to a routine so that when he cannot be fed at 5 O’clock on the dot, he will not get frustrated or anxious. However, routines are important for puppies and new dogs as they acclimatise themselves to living with you.
